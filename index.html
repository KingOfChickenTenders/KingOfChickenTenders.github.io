<h2>UFC</h2> <br>
	<p>While most people will choose sports like Soccer, or Base Ball I chose MMA</p>
	<p>MMA can be one of the most dangerous contanct sports in modern times, i've dislocated my knee cap a couple of times and broken bones. But I still continue on fighting.</p>
	<p>It hurts a bit, but it's fun and it will toughen you up</p>

	<h2>Video Games</h2>
	<p>After a long day of training I need to relax and calm down. Video Games are one  of the things that I do to </p>
	<p>I mainly play FPS, and Adventure games</p>
